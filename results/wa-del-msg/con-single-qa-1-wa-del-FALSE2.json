          "explanation": "The recording clearly demonstrates the ability to delete a message for the user themselves only. At t=27s, a delete dialog appears with two distinct options: 'Delete for everyone' and 'Delete for me'. At t=34s, after the user appears to have selected 'Delete for me', the message 'Delete test message' is replaced with the system notification 'You deleted this message.' at 4:27 PM, confirming successful deletion for self only. The message was not removed from the chat history entirely but replaced with a deletion indicator, which is consistent with 'delete for me' functionality where the message remains visible to others."
