The user types a message (frames 4-11), sends it successfully, then accesses deletion through a long-press context menu (frame 16), which presents a clear 'Delete' option. However, the process requires multiple steps: composing message, long-pressing the message bubble, selecting from a menu, then choosing delete type. While each step follows familiar mobile patterns, the multi-step nature and nested menus suggest a slight learning curve rather than being completely intuitive."
