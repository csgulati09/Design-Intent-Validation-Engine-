          "explanation": "The message deletion process follows a discoverable and intuitive interaction pattern. The user successfully completes a standard long-press gesture on a message, which reveals a contextual menu with clearly labeled options including 'Delete' in red (standard destructive action color). The flow includes appropriate confirmation with a modal asking 'Delete message?' and offering two clear choices ('Delete for everyone' and 'Delete for me'). The entire process aligns with common messaging app conventions and shows no signs of user confusion or hesitation. The system provides immediate feedback with 'You deleted this message' confirmation, completing the feedback loop."
