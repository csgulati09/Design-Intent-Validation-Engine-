At frame 34 (t=34s), a new deletion notification 'You deleted this message.' appears in the Today section at 4:27 PM, confirming the deletion was completed. The assertion states the user should be able to delete 'for me only and not for everyone', but the evidence shows both options were available to the user, contradicting the 'not for everyone' requirement."
