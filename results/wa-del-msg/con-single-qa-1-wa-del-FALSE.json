The user long-presses a message labeled 'Delete test message', opens the context menu, navigates through multiple deletion options, and ultimately selects 'Delete for me' from a dialog presenting both 'Delete for everyone' and 'Delete for me' options. The message is then successfully deleted, as evidenced by the appearance of 'You deleted this message.' indicator at the bottom of the chat screen at timestamp 34s."
