Two distinct deletion workflows are observed: (1) Long-press context menu with 'Delete' option appearing at 16 seconds, and (2) Selection mode with trash icon at 20 seconds. Both paths lead to the same deletion confirmation dialog and successfully delete the message. The presence of two separate UI patterns for initiating message deletion fails the requirement for a single deletion method."
