          "explanation": "The assertion states that the send button should not be a default button but should render based on user action. Throughout the sequence, we observe dynamic send button behavior: When the message input is empty (frames 58, 66, 70), the send button appears as a microphone icon (voice message button). However, once the user types text (frames 27-55), the button transforms into a green send arrow. This demonstrates that the button is indeed rendered conditionally based on user input rather than displaying as a static default button, which is the expected forgiving and intentional interaction pattern."
