While there are video call icons visible in earlier frames (Frame 3 showing a video call icon in the header), the final state at Frame 14 shows the user has returned to the main Chats list without demonstrating the presence of a call button in the individual chat view. The flow shows search → entering chat → sending message, but does not conclusively show the call button being present and accessible in the chat screen where the user would initiate a call."
