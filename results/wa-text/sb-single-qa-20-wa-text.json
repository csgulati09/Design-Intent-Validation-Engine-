The entire process follows standard messaging app patterns with clear visual feedback at each step, including the search interface with categorized filters, the keyboard with autocomplete suggestions, and message delivery indicators. The user returned to the chat list at t=14.2s where the sent message is visible as the most recent message in 'Me' chat."
