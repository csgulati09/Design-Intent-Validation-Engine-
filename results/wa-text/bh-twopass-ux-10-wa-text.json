The evidence shows that initially (at 4.7s-8.6s) while the user is typing, there is no explicit mention of a send button being visible. At 9.4s, after the user completes typing 'Hello test message!', the timeline explicitly states 'the send button (green arrow) now visible and enabled.' This confirms that the send button appeared dynamically in response to the user's action of typing a message, rather than being present by default. The button only became visible once there was content in the text input field."
