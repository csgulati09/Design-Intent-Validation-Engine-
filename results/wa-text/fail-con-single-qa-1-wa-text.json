However, the recording clearly shows that when the user opens a chat (at t=3s) and types a message 'Hello test message!' (t=4-11s), the interface changes from showing a call button to showing a send button (green circular button with an arrow/send icon) at t=5s onwards. This contradicts the assertion that the interface 'doesn't change when the user types the message.' Additionally, no call is made in this recording, so the second part of the assertion (about the screen changing to a call screen) cannot be verified."
