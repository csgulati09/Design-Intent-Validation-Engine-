          "explanation": "The send button demonstrates dynamic, contextual behavior rather than being a default persistent button. Initially (frames 4-11), the keyboard shows a 'return' button in the bottom-right, not a send button. As the user types 'Hello test message!' the send button appears as a green circular icon in the top-right (frame 11), indicating it renders only when there's content to send. After sending (frame 12), the message appears in the chat and the send button returns to its inactive state. This confirms the send button is not a default element but renders based on user action (typing text)."
