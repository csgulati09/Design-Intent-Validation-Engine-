The search functionality activates immediately with clear visual feedback (filter options appear), search results are displayed promptly and relevantly, and the messaging interface follows standard conventions with a visible text input field and successful message delivery confirmation. The user completes the entire task efficiently without apparent confusion or backtracking. Minor points preventing full confidence: the 'Ask' button that appears during search isn't explained in context, and there's a 3-second delay between completing the message and it being sent (timestamps 8.7 to 11.8), which could indicate unclear send action or system processing time."
