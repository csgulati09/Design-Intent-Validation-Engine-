It first appears when the user types 'Hello' at 5 seconds, showing as a green send button on the right side of the message input field. The button remains visible and active through timestamps 6-11 seconds as the user continues typing. At timestamp 11 seconds, the user interacts with the send button (indicated by color change), and at timestamp 12 seconds, the message is successfully sent, confirming the button was both visible and functional."
