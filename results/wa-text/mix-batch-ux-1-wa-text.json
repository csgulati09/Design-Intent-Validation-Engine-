The keyboard provides helpful autocomplete suggestions ('Hello', 'there', etc.) that speed up typing. The send button clearly changes from a sticker/attachment icon to a green send arrow when text is entered, providing clear affordance. The user completes the task smoothly without any visible confusion, hesitation, or errors. The flow is: search → tap contact → type message → send → return to chats - all standard and predictable. The double checkmark feedback confirms message delivery. However, there are minor cognitive load points: the search field label 'Ask Meta AI or Search' may introduce slight confusion about dual functionality, and the abundance of UI elements on the main screen (filters, badges, icons) creates some visual noise."
