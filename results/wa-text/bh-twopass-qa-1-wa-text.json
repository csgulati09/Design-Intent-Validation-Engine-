          "explanation": "The send button behavior clearly demonstrates dynamic rendering based on user action. Initially, when the message input field is empty (frames at 4 seconds), there is no send button visible - confirming it's not a default always-present button. As the user types text (frames 5-10 seconds), the green send button appears and becomes visible only after content is entered. At 11 seconds, the button shows a pressed state (darker green) when tapped, further demonstrating interactive state changes. After sending (frame 12 seconds), the button disappears again as the input field becomes empty. This behavior confirms the send button renders conditionally based on user input rather than being a static default element."
