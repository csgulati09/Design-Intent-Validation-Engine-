          "explanation": "The assertion states that the send button should not be the default button but should render based on user action. The evidence shows that initially there is no visible send button mentioned when the chat screen first loads (timestamp 3.9s). The send button appears only after the user starts typing text (timestamp 5.5s shows 'Green send button visible on right side of input field'). This behavior continues through subsequent typing actions. The send button is rendered in response to the user's action of typing a message, not displayed by default when the message input field is empty. This matches the expected behavior described in the assertion."
