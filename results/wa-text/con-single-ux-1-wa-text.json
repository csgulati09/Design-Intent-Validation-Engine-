The button appears as a green circular icon with a send arrow/paper plane symbol, positioned in the bottom-right area of the message composition area. It's visible in multiple frames both when the keyboard is displayed (frames 4-11) and when the user returns to the chat list (frame 14 shows the message was successfully sent). The button's visibility is clear and consistent across the entire flow."
