The user taps the search bar, types to find the 'Me' contact, accesses the conversation, and composes a message. The keyboard appears automatically when the message field is focused, autocomplete suggestions appear while typing, and the send button becomes prominently available when text is entered. The message is successfully sent and appears in the chat list with confirmation indicators. The overall experience demonstrates clear affordances, predictable interactions, and smooth transitions between steps."
