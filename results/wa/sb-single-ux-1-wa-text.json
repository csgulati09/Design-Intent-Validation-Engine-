The search functionality is prominently placed at the top with clear affordance ('Ask Meta AI or Search'). Tapping it reveals a familiar filter view by content type. When the user types 'Me', the interface immediately shows relevant results and allows direct access to the chat. The keyboard appearance is automatic and expected. Typing the message 'Hello test message!' is straightforward with standard keyboard interactions and predictive text suggestions. The send button transitions from a sticker/camera icon to a clear green arrow send button when text is entered, providing good feedback. The message appears immediately in the chat with timestamp and delivery status (checkmark). The overall flow feels natural with minimal cognitive load - each step follows logically from the previous one with clear visual feedback and standard interaction patterns."
