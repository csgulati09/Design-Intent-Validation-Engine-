          "explanation": "The assertion states that the send button should not be a default button but should render based on user action. The recording shows that when the message input is empty, there is no prominent send button visible (frames 0-4). As the user types 'Hello test message!' (frames 8-47), a green circular send button appears in the bottom-right corner (clearly visible from frame 27 onwards at t=5.4s). After the message is sent (frame 62 at t=12.4s), the send button disappears again and the input field is empty (frames 66-74). This behavior demonstrates that the send button dynamically renders in response to user input rather than being a persistent default button, confirming the assertion."
