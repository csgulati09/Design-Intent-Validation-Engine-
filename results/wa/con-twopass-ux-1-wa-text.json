It first appears when the user enters the message input field at timestamp 4, and remains visible through the typing process (timestamps 5-11). The button shows clear visual feedback: it turns green when text is entered (timestamp 5), indicating it's ready to send, becomes darker green on hover/pre-tap (timestamp 11), and successfully sends the message (timestamp 12). The button's presence and state changes are consistently documented across multiple timeline entries."
