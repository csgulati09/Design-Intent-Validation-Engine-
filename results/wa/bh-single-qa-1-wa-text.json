          "explanation": "The assertion states that the send button should not be the default button and should render based on user action. Observing the frames, in frames 4-11, when the user is typing 'Hello test message!', the send button on the right side of the input field changes from a microphone icon (default state) to a green circular send/arrow button. After the message is sent (frame 12-14), the button reverts back to the default state (microphone icon) when the input field is empty. This demonstrates that the send button dynamically changes appearance based on user input, confirming the assertion."
