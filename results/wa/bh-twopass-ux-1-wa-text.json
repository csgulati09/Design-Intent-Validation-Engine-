          "explanation": "The send button behavior demonstrates adaptive rendering based on user action rather than being a default visible button. At 4.7s when the user first taps the message input field, no send button is mentioned. At 5.5s when the user types 'Hello', autocomplete suggestions appear but the send button state is not explicitly described. Critically, at 8.6s after the user completes typing 'Hello test message!', the timeline explicitly states 'The send button appears enabled and ready for submission.' This indicates the send button was not present by default but rather appeared/became enabled as a direct result of the user's typing action. This is classic adaptive UI behavior where the send button only renders or becomes actionable when there is content to send."
